# [Project Name] - API

This the server application for [Project Name], exposing an API for managing [Project Name]'s users and data.

## Response Payloads

Response payloads are exclusively in JSON and the top-level JSON object follows this format:

- `message?`: a string; a notable message about the success or failure of a response.
- `data?`: where any data goes, if the request prompted some data.
- `fieldErrors?`: an object; where field validation errors go, if the request was a form submission.
- `links?`: an object; where URIs for links go, especially for pagination.

All payloads have at least one of these properties.

### The `fieldErrors` property

The value of `fieldErrors` is a key-value object wherein the keys are input paths, and their values are their validation error message.

```json
{
  "message": "There are some validation errors with your submission.",
  "fieldErrors": {
    "username": "Usernames must be between 2 and 16 characters long.",
    "confirmPassword": "Passwords do not match."
  }
}
```
